} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://localhost:8243/donations/1.0.0/donations" -Headers $headers -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json" -SkipCertificateCheck
```

**Talking Points**:
> "This shows the complete OAuth2 flow. The token authenticates us, 
> WSO2 validates it, checks our permissions, enforces rate limits, 
> and forwards the request to our backend."

---

### **Part 4: Benefits & Value Proposition (2 min)**

### **Part 5: Q&A Preparation (1 min)**

**Be ready to answer**:

❓ **"How does OAuth2 work in your implementation?"**
> "I'm using Client Credentials flow. Applications register in DevPortal, 
> get client credentials, exchange them for an access token, and use that 
> token for API requests. WSO2 validates every token."

❓ **"What if backend is down?"**
> "WSO2 has health checks. If backend is unhealthy, WSO2 returns 503. 
> We can configure multiple backend endpoints for failover."

❓ **"How do you handle rate limiting?"**
> "WSO2 enforces throttling policies. We have tiers: Unlimited, Gold, 
> Silver, Bronze. Once limit is hit, WSO2 rejects requests at gateway 
> level, protecting the backend."

❓ **"Can you add more APIs?"**
> "Yes! Just create new API in Publisher, import OpenAPI spec or design 
> from scratch, configure endpoint, and publish. Takes minutes."

❓ **"How does this scale?"**
> "Both WSO2 and Laravel can scale horizontally. Add more containers, 
> WSO2 load balances automatically. Database can be replicated. 
> Ready for Kubernetes deployment."

❓ **"What about security testing?"**
> "Try accessing API without token - it fails. Try with invalid token - 
> fails. Try with valid token but wrong scope - fails. WSO2 enforces 
> security at every level."
