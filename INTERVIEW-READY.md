✅ "Enterprise-grade security out-of-the-box"
✅ "Centralized API management for all services"
✅ "Built-in analytics and monitoring"
✅ "Developer portal for self-service"
✅ "Rate limiting to protect backend"
✅ "Production-proven, scalable solution"

### **Technical Highlights**
🔹 "OAuth2 Client Credentials flow for machine-to-machine auth"
🔹 "Scopes for fine-grained permissions (read/write)"
🔹 "Throttling policies to prevent abuse"
🔹 "OpenAPI spec for documentation"
🔹 "Docker containers for easy deployment"
🔹 "React + TypeScript for modern UI"

### **Real-World Value**

💼 "Monetization ready (charge per tier)"
💼 "Full audit trail and compliance"
💼 "Faster development with self-service portal"
💼 "Scales to millions of requests"

---

## 🎯 **INTERVIEW QUESTIONS YOU'LL ACE**

### ❓ "Walk me through your architecture"
> "Sure! Users interact with a React frontend. When they make a donation, 
> the request goes to WSO2 API Gateway. WSO2 validates the OAuth2 token, 
> checks permissions via scopes, enforces rate limits, and forwards to 
> Laravel backend. Laravel validates data and stores in MySQL. 
> All analytics are captured by WSO2."

### ❓ "How does OAuth2 work here?"
> "I'm using Client Credentials flow. Applications register in DevPortal, 
> receive client_id and client_secret. They exchange these for an access_token. 
> This token is included in API requests as 'Bearer token'. WSO2 validates 
> every token before forwarding requests."

### ❓ "What if someone tries to abuse your API?"
> "WSO2 has throttling policies. I've configured tiers like Gold (5000 req/hr), 
> Silver (2000 req/hr), Bronze (500 req/hr). Once limit is hit, WSO2 rejects 
> at gateway level, protecting my backend. Plus, OAuth2 ensures only 
> authenticated clients can access."

### ❓ "How would you scale this?"
> "The architecture is already scale-ready. WSO2 and Laravel can both scale 
> horizontally - just add more containers. WSO2 has built-in load balancing. 
> MySQL can be replicated. Everything is containerized, so deploying to 
> Kubernetes is straightforward."

### ❓ "What about security?"
> "Multiple layers: OAuth2 for authentication, scopes for authorization, 
> HTTPS for encryption, rate limiting for DDoS protection, input validation 
> in Laravel, SQL injection prevention with ORM, CORS configuration, 
> and full audit logs in WSO2."
